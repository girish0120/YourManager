				<h3>Premium</h3>
				<body>
								<p>We have limited resources to run the bot and running the bot with limited resources wouldn't last long so you join the premium plan of YourManager by donating just a little amount towards YourManager and getting a premium bot with a lot more features and a seperately displayed role in the server. I hope you would like to be a contributor towards this project and help run the basic as well as premium bot smoothly.
